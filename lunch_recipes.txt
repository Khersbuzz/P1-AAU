Penne Chicken and Mushroom
5 mins to prep & 30 mins to cook
10
Chicken breast: 1 breast, bone and skin removed
Pasta: 1 1/4 cup
Mushrooms: 3/4 cup, whole
Garlic: 1/2 clove
Olive oil: 1 tbsp
Pepper: 1/2 dash
Parsley: 1/2 tsp
Lowfat milk: 1/4 cup
Salt: 1/2 tbsp
Cheddar cheese: 1/2 cup, shredded
7
Step 1: Heat a pot of water to cook the pasta, and when it starts to boil, pour the tablespoon of sea salt stirring until its completely dissolved. Add then the pasta and stir every now and again to avoid sticking to the pot.
Step 2: While the pasta cooks, chop the mushrooms in strips and the chicken breasts into small squares of about a centimeter in length and half a centimetre thick. Grate cheese and set aside for later.
Step 3: In a pan, add clove of garlic (after removing its skin) with the extra-virgin olive oil and heat it at a low flame until the garlic starts to turn lightly brown and “wilted”.
Step 4: Remove the clove of garlic and toss mushrooms into pan, heating them at a medium-high flame for about five minutes, stirring frequently. When the liquid in the pan is almost completely evaporated, add chicken squares, salt and pepper. Stir for about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
Step 5: In a saucepan, heat milk and shredded cheese until cheese is melted into the milk, stirring continuously.
Step 6: Return mushroom and chicken to heat. Drain then the pasta and put it in the pan with your chicken and mushroom. After mixture is heated, pour cheese sauce over all.
Step 7: Stir well for another minute until the mixture of cheese and milk will have reached a creamy consistency and coated to the pasta.
